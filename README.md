# 🎓 Student Career Resolver Quiz

This is a simple career interest quiz website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I built this project to help 10th class students understand their interests and choose the right stream after school.

The quiz contains 10 easy questions based on student interests.  
After answering all questions, the website suggests a suitable stream like:

- Science
- Commerce
- Arts
- Or Mixed Interests


## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML for structure  
- CSS for design  
- JavaScript for quiz logic and result calculation  



##  Purpose of This Project

##  How It Works

1. Students answer 10 simple interest-based questions.
